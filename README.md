# My-first-Excel-Project
Created a Bike Sales Dashboard in Excel using slicers and pivot tables. Learned to clean data with Remove Duplicates and improved logic from =IFS(L2 >54, "Old...", L2 >=31 AND L2 &lt;55, "Middle...") to =IFS(L2 > 54, "Old", AND(L2 >= 31, L2 &lt;= 54), "Middle", L2 &lt; 31, "Adolescent") for accurate age grouping.
